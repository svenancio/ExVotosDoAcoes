  This program was made for (Do)Ação installation, by COM.6. It is a video mapping
  application which uses a series of face images captured previously and projects
  them. By default, six images are loaded per time, they keep changing according to
  random "durations" (see code below)
  Instructions:
  key 'p' - pan mode, click and drag mouse to move the selected image along the screen
  key 'z' - zoom mode, click and drag mouse to zoom in or out the selected image
  keys 1-6 - change the selected image
  spacebar - start or stop recording frames - each frame is put into "video" folder
  
  In order to use this software, place some images inside "faces" folder. This code
  does not handle file format, so make sure you only put images inside this folder
